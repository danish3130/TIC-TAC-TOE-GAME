TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME

Tic Tac Toe is a classic paper-and-pencil game for two players, traditionally played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking spaces in the grid with their respective symbols, usually "X" and "O", with the goal of achieving a winning pattern before the opponent.

Objective:
The objective of Tic Tac Toe is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their marks.

Gameplay:
Initial Setup: The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

Player Turns: Players take turns marking one empty cell at a time with their symbol ("X" or "O").

Winning Conditions: The game is won by the player who successfully places three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. The game ends as soon as a player achieves this pattern.

Draw Condition: If all cells are filled and no player has achieved a winning pattern, the game is a draw.

Rules:
Players alternate turns, with one player marking "X" and the other marking "O".
A player cannot overwrite a cell that has already been marked by either player.
The game continues until either a player wins or the board is completely filled (resulting in a draw).


Strategy:
The game's simplicity allows for various strategies, including trying to create a winning pattern while simultaneously blocking the opponent's attempts.
Players can aim for multiple winning patterns simultaneously to increase their chances of winning.
Variations:
Tic Tac Toe can be played on larger grids for added complexity.
There are also advanced versions with additional rules and variations, such as allowing more than two players or introducing special cells with extra abilities.
Tic Tac Toe is a timeless game enjoyed by people of all ages due to its simple rules, strategic depth, and quick gameplay. It's often used as a teaching tool for introducing basic concepts of game theory and strategy.
